# Reproducibility guidelines {#sec-guidelines}

There's lots of guidance to support reproducible research. This book focuses specifically on healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models, drawing from two particularly relevant frameworks:

* The recommendations from Heather et al. 2025.
* The NHS Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) Maturity Framework.

This book walks through how to address all aspects of these guidelines, and the links below (üîó) take you to relevant pages with detailed guidance on each topic.

## Reproducibility recommendations from Heather et al. 2025

As part of the project STARS (Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulations), a series of computational reproducibility assessments were conducted by Heather et al. 2025. From these, several recommendations were shared to support reproducibility of healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models, as described in:

> Heather, A. Monks, T. Harper, A. Mustafee, N. Mayne, A. On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models (2025). arxiv. <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137>.

Those marked with a star (‚≠ê) were identified as having the greatest impact in Heather et al. 2025.

## 'Levels of RAP' Maturity Framework

The following framework has been directly copied from the RAP Community of Practice repository/website: [NHS RAP Levels of RAP Framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/).

This framework is maintained by the NHS RAP Community of Practice and is ¬© 2024 Crown Copyright (NHS England), shared by them under the terms of the [Open Government 3.0 licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

The specific version of the framework copied below is that from commit [2549256](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice/commit/2549256498886d6d7ea4cdb736e2a2864c8bb461) (9th September 2024).
