In guiding you to develop reproducible discrete-event simulation (DES) models, this book draws from two relevant guidelines:

::: {.pale-blue}

(1) **Recommendations for reproducible DES** from Heather et al. (2025).

(2) **A framework for reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)** from the NHS RAP Community of Practice.
:::

Each chapter demonstrates how to put these guidelines into practice. Use the links below (üîó) to jump straight to relevant pages for each item in the frameworks.

This page may be particularly helpful if you not necessarily building a healthcare DES model, but are simply interested in improving reproducibility more generally.

## Heather et al. (2025) Recommendations

<details>
<summary>Show/Hide Recommendations</summary>

As part of the project STARS (Sharing Tools and Artefacts for Reproducible Simulations), a series of computational reproducibility assessments were conducted by Heather et al. 2025. From these, several recommendations were shared to support reproducibility of healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models, as described in:

> Heather, A. Monks, T. Harper, A. Mustafee, N. Mayne, A. On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models (2025). arxiv. <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137>.

Those marked with a star (‚≠ê) were identified as having the greatest impact in Heather et al. 2025.

## NHS 'Levels of RAP' Maturity Framework

<details>
<summary>Show/Hide Framework</summary>

The following framework has been directly copied from the RAP Community of Practice repository/website: [NHS RAP Levels of RAP Framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/).

This framework is maintained by the NHS RAP Community of Practice and is ¬© 2024 Crown Copyright (NHS England), shared by them under the terms of the [Open Government 3.0 licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

The specific version of the framework copied below is that from commit [2549256](https://github.com/NHSDigital/rap-community-of-practice/commit/2549256498886d6d7ea4cdb736e2a2864c8bb461) (9th September 2024).
