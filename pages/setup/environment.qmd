Dependency management is about keeping track of the environment used for your project. This includes the version of your programming languages, any packages used, and their versions.

It acts like a **time capsule**, allowing you to return to a project later and run it with the exact same packages and versions, reproducing the results generated previously.

Dependency management enables you to **isolate environments for different projects**. Each project can have it's own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts and making it easy to switch between projects.

It is also important for **collaboration**, so that everyone working on the project is using the same environment.

## Python tools for dependency management

There are lots of tools available for managing dependencies in isolated environments in python. A few of the most popular tools include **venv**, **conda**, and **poetry**.

In this book, we will use **conda**, as it allows us to **specify a python version**, so each environment we create can have a different specific version of python. This is not possible with venv and poetry, which just manage the package dependencies, and will just use the system python.

## Mamba

**Mamba** is a drop-in replacement for conda that is often preferred as it is:

* Faster than conda.
* Better at dealing with dependency conflicts, providing more helpful messages in cases where environments fail to builds due to clashing requirements of different packages.

To use mamba, simply replace `conda` in all the commands below with `mamba`.

<br>

## Installing conda (or mamba)

Refer to the conda or mamba documentation for the latest instructions on installing these for your operating system (windows, mac or linux).

* [Conda installation instructions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
* [Mamba installation instructions](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).

## Setting up our conda environment

**1. Create an environment file.** In the project root, we create üìÑ`environment.yaml`.

```{.bash}
touch environment.yaml
```

Within this file, we add three sections:

* **Name**. The environment name.
* **Channels**. Where to find packages (e.g. `conda-forge`). <!--TODO: explain about options here, and why we chose conda-forge-->
* **Dependencies**. The packages you need.

When first creating our environment, we just list the dependencies we know we need at this point - we can always add more later! At the start of a project, you might only know one: python.

As an example, we will add `simpy` and python.

```{.bash}
name: des-example
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python
  - simpy
```

<br>

**2. Build and activate the environment**. In the command line, run the following to create your environment:

```{.bash}
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

You can then activate it (replacing `des-example` with your environment name):

```{.bash}
conda activate des-example
```

To confirm your environment contains the expected packages, run:

```{.bash}
conda list
```

This will output a list of packages, versions, builds and channels. For example, it may look similar to:

```
(des-example) amy@xps:~/Documents/hospital-des$ conda list
# packages in environment at /home/amy/mambaforge/envs/des-example:

**3. Specify versions**. For reproducibility, it's best to specify the exact package versions in you `environment.yaml`. If you're starting from scratch, you may not know which versions you need, so you can leave them out initially, as we did in step 1.

However, now that we have built our environment (which used the latest versions as none were specified), it is important to then record your versions in the üìÑ`environment.yaml`. These are the versions you saw when running `conda list`. For example:

```{.bash}
name: des-example
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python=3.13.3
  - simpy=4.1.1
```

<br>

**4. Setting up the full environment for this book.** When working on a project from scratch, you will often build up your environment organically and iteratively as you find more packages you want to use. However, to follow along with this book and ensure everything works as expected, you can use the full environment provided below. Copy this into your üìÑ`environment.yaml` (feel free to alter the name!):

```{.bash}
name: des-example
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - ipykernel=6.29.5
  - jinja2=3.1.5
  - joblib=1.4.2
  - nbconvert=7.16.6
  - nbformat=5.10.4
  - nbqa=1.9.0
  - numpy=2.2.2
  - pandas=2.2.3
  - pip=25.0
  - plotly_express=0.4.1
  - pylint=3.3.4
  - pytest=8.3.4
  - pytest-xdist=3.6.1
  - python=3.13.1
  - rich=13.9.4
  - simpy=4.1.1
  - pip:
    - kaleido==0.2.1
    - sim-tools==0.8.0
```

Then update your environment to include these packages (after running `conda activate des-example`) with:

```{.bash}
conda env update --file environment.yaml --prune
```



<!-- either make full section explaining that need to check run etc, or remove
::: {.callout-note}

## Updating packages

If want to update all your packages, you can run:

```{.bash}
conda update --all
```

If you do this, make sure to update the `environment.yaml` to reflect these changes.

## R tools for dependency management

:::{.callout-warning}
‚ö†Ô∏è EVERYTHING BELOW IS WORK IN PROGRESS ‚ö†Ô∏è
:::

<br>

The most popular tool for managing dependencies in R is **renv**. This replaced and improved upon the previous tool, **Packrat**.

Renv will create isolated environments with the specific packages and their versions for a project. However, it **won't manage the version of R used** - the version of R used is simply whatever is installed on your system. <!--TODO: add note about how to switch R versions-->

<!--TODO: had wanted to explore rig... thoughts... anything to mention here on other tools...?-->

<br>

## Setting up renv from scratch

**1. Initialise renv**. Run the command below to get started with renv.

```{.r}
renv::init()
```

This will add three new files/folders to the project:

* `renv/library/`: stores packages used in project.
* `renv.lock`: record of packages used, so they can be re-installed on a new machine.
* `.Rprofile`: ensures that renv is activated when open project.

<br>

**2. Create a DESCRIPTION file**. While not required, it is good practice to create a DESCRIPTION file. This file is standard for R packages (@sec-package), but is also helpful for regular projects using renv.

It lists the main dependencies in a clear, human-readable way, and can specify versions. This makes it easier to see what packages are required, unlike the verbose `renv.lock` file, which will list every package (the main packages plus all of their dependencies).

As an example, create the file in the project root:

```{.bash}
touch DESCRIPTION
```

Then copy in:

```{.r}
Package: simulation
Type: Package
Title: Simulation
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: c(
    person(
      "Amy", "Heather",
      email = "a.heather2@exeter.ac.uk",
      role = c("aut", "cre")
    )
  )

    lintr,

Config/testthat/edition: 3
```

These are all dependencies we know we will need for this book. But if you were starting from scratch, would just add what need as go along, and iteratively expand it.
<!--TODO: explain imports vs suggests-->

<br>

**3. Install packages from DESCRIPTION**. The command below will install the packages (and their dependencies) into your project library. It will typically install the latest available versions <!--TODO: check if it doesn't if you specify versions... i found specifying didn't necessarily mean it fixed versions...-->

<!--TODO: add note about how it asks you 1 2 3 options re building from description-->

```{.r}
renv::install()
```

<br>

**4. Save environment to lockfile**. Having installed these packages, we then save the current state of the project library to a lock file. This updates `renv.lock`, which is a record of the exact packages and versions used in the project.

```{.r}
renv::snapshot()
```

<!--TODO: add note about how in r, working with specific r and packages, bit different to python, bit harder, suppoesdly forwards compatabile but no guarantee, often way of working is building a new env based on known packages, and backdating versions if something not working because of that... but also you can direct reuse an renv, as below, just check same version of r and so on, and other stuff, its not super simple-->

<br>

## Restoring a previous renv from lockfile

**1. Obtain lockfile**. If you are attempting to restore an environment from a lockfile, you need to obtain that `renv.lock`.  This provides details on packages and versions to be restored (but not R version). As an example: TBC.
<!--TODO: download option for renv?-->

<br>

**2. Initialise renv**. As before, initialise `renv` for the project. <!--TODO: note that this time it will have a message like there are existing files-->

```{.r}
renv::init()
```

<br>

**3. Restore the environment**. Restore the provided `renv` based on the lock file. This will install the exact packages listed in the lockfile.

```{.r}
renv::restore()
```

<br>

## System dependencies

Some R packages required external system libraries. The exact requirements will depend on which packages you use, what operating system you have, and whether you have used R before.

For example, working on Ubuntu, we found that we had to install the following system dependencies for `igraph`:

```{.bash}
sudo apt install build-essential gfortran
sudo apt install libglpk-dev libxml2-dev
```
