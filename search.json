    "section": "Creating a branch and pushing changes",
    "text": "Creating a branch and pushing changes\nIt is best practice to work in branches. A branch is like a separate workspace where you can safely experiment with changes without affecting the main project.\nAs in the diagram below, you can make several commits in this branch, and when you’re ready, merge back into the main project (e.g. when new feature complete, or reached a stable point where everything is working properly).\nThis is valuable even when you’re the only person working on the repository - but with multiple collaborator, becomes essential! Every person should work on their own branch.\n\nTo work in a branch and push changes…\n1. Create a branch. Open your terminal or Git Bash, and make sure your current working directory is your Git repository. To create a new branch (here, named dev), then run:\ngit branch dev\nTo move into this branch:\ngit checkout dev\nYou should see a message “Switched to branch ‘dev’”.\nWe can add this branch to the remote GitHub repository by running:\ngit push -u origin dev\n2. Make some changes. This could be any changes to code, documentation or other artefacts in the repository. So we can test this out, let’s make a simple change to our README -\nBefore:\n# hospital-des\nDiscrete-event simulation of a hospital emergency department.\nAfter:\n# Hospital DES\n\nDiscrete-event simulation of a hospital emergency department.\n\nAuthor: Amy Heather\n\nWork in progress!\n3. Commit the changes. To save this new version of our file to Git, we need to commit the changes. We use git add to choose which files to commit. We then write a descriptive commit message using git commit. Finally, we push the changes using git push.\ngit add README.md\ngit commit -m \"docs(README): add author + work-in-progress notice\"\ngit push\n4. Merge the changes. One of the easiest ways to merge changes into main is using the GitHub website. Open your repository. You should see that you now have “2 Branches”. Navigate to your new branch…\n\nWe can see this is now 1 commit ahead of main. We can browse the files in this branch, and can click on the right hand “2 Commits” to view the version history.\n\nThis just has 2 commits - the creation of our repository, and the change to our README file:\n\nTo merge the changes with main, go back to the page for that branch, and select either:\n\n“This branch is 1 commit ahead of main”, or\n“Compare & pull request”\n\n\nThis will open a page which shows all the new commits in your branch, and side-by-side changes the files you have modified.\nClick the green “Create pull request” button.\n\nA pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch to another. This provides an opportunity, for example, for others to review the changes and make sure they are happy before these are merged.\nWe can modify the message - or just leave as is, and select the “Create pull request” button.\n\nIf new changes have been made to the main branch since you created your branch (e.g., new commits, merges from other branches, or contributions from other collaborators) and you’ve modified the same files, you may encounter merge conflicts that need to be resolved.\nIf not though, you can just select “Merge pull request” and then “Confirm merge”.\n\n\n5. Close your branch. We can now delete the branch-\n\nOn our local machine, switch back to main:\ngit checkout main\nThen pull the updated main branch, which contains our merged changes:\ngit pull\nWe can then delete our local branch:\ngit branch -d dev\nAnd also get the latest list of branches from the remote repository, with our old branch now removed:\ngit remote prune origin\nTo continue working in the repository, simply create a new branch and continue as above.",

While this works well for person projects, you will often find it better to create repositories within a GitHub organisation instead.\nA GitHub organisation acts like a shared account which multiple people can own, access and collaborate on. Advantages of this are:\n\nOne place for each project/team. Related repositories are grouped into one organisation. For example, you could have different organisations for different teams or projects, with all the relevant repositories for each.\nShared ownership. Multiple people can have administrative access.\nContinuity. If you leave a project, repositories remain accessible to and owned by the team.\nProfessional branding.

    "text": "Packaging our model\n\n\nCreating a package\nIn Python, a package is simply a directory with containing an 📄__init__.py file, which makes that directory recognisable as a package. The basic structure for our package is:\nour_directory/\n├── simulation/             # Main package directory\n│   ├── __init__.py         # Makes the directory a package\n│   ├── model.py            # Code for the model\n│   └── ...                 # Other .py files (e.g. parameters, replications)\n└── pyproject.toml          # Package metadata\nThe code for the model is contained in 📁simulation/ within individual python files (e.g. 📄model.py). The 📄__init__.py file identifies this directory as a package and contains basic metadata:\n\"\"\"SimPy Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) Model.\n\"\"\"\n\n__version__ = \"0.1.0\"\nThe 📄pyproject.toml file in the root directory contains package configuration information. We’re using flit as our build tool because of its simplicity.

This means it will update with any changes to the source code in 📁simulation/.\nIn a conda 📄environment.yaml file:\nname: our-environment\nchannels:\n  - conda-forge\ndependencies:\n  - python\n  - simpy\n  - pip:\n    - -e .[dev]\nIn a 📄requirements.txt file:\nsimpy\n-e .[dev]\n\n\n\nFurther information\n\n“How I use Python to organize my data analyses” from Joshua Cook 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a package\nA basic R package structure looks like this:\nour_directory/\n├── R/                  # Directory containing R functions\n│   ├── model.R         # Code for the model\n│   └── ...             # Other .R files (e.g. parameters, replications)\n├── man/                # Documentation (generated from roxygen comments)\n├── tests/              # Unit tests\n├── DESCRIPTION         # Package metadata\n├── NAMESPACE           # Package exports (usually generated)\n└── rmarkdown/          # Analysis notebooks\nThe core of our package is the 📁R/ directory, which contains all our simulation functions within R files (e.g. 📄model.R). Each function should be documented using roxygen2-style comments that will automatically generate the documentation in the 📁man/ directory. Writing these docstrings is covered in Docstrings.\nThe DESCRIPTION file contains essential metadata about the package:\nPackage: simulation\nType: Package\nTitle: Simulation\nVersion: 0.1.0\nAuthors@R: c(\n    person(\n      \"Amy\", \"Heather\",\n      email = \"a.heather2@exeter.ac.uk\",\n      role = c(\"aut\", \"cre\")\n    )\n  )\nURL: https://github.com/pythonhealthdatascience/rap_template_r_des\nDescription: Template reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP) for simple R\n    discrete-event simulation (DES) model.\nLicense: MIT + file LICENSE\nEncoding: UTF-8\nLazyData: true\nRoxygenNote: 7.3.2\nImports:\n    simmer,\n    magrittr,\n    dplyr,\n    purrr,\n    rlang,\n    tidyr,\n    tidyselect,\n    future,\n    future.apply,\n    ggplot2,\n    tibble,\n    gridExtra,\n    R6\nSuggests:\n    testthat (&gt;= 3.0.0),\n    patrick,\n    lintr,\n    devtools,\n    xtable,\n    data.table,\n    mockery\nConfig/testthat/edition: 3\n\n\nInstalling and using the package\nWe use the devtools package to build and install our package:\n# Install the package from the local directory\ndevtools::install()\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(simulation)\n\n# Now you can use functions from the package...\nWhen developing the package, these commands are particularly helpful:\n\ndevtools::document() to reproduce documentation in 📁man/ after changes to the docstrings.\ndevtools::check() to build and check the package follows best practices.\ndevtools::install() to load the latest version of the package into your environment.\ndevtools::test() to run the tests in 📁tests/.\n\nFor analysis and reporting, we store our files in the 📁rmarkdown/ directory rather than in 📁vignettes/. This is because files in 📁vignettes/ are re-run with every package build/check. For simulations with longer run times, this can be inefficient - although this may be of interest for quicker simulations, as it will help ensure you always run everything from scratch.
