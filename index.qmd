This book is a step-by-step guide to writing reproducible discrete-event simulation models in **Python and R**. It guides you through creating these models whilst **meeting reproducibility requirements** from:

* üåø [Heather et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137) "On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models"
* üè• The ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice 

These are described further in @sec-guidelines: Reproducibility guidelines.

The models are created using:

* **SimPy** for Python - <https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.
* **simmer** for R - <https://r-simmer.org/>.

This book uses **healthcare discrete-event simulation** models as its primary case study - modelling patient flows and resource allocation in clinical settings. However, the reproducibility principles and coding practices can be applied in other fields and for other modelling and analysis techniques.

It has been developed as part of the STARS project:
