This is a guide to writing discrete-event simulation (DES) models in **Python and R** which are reproducible and form a reproducible analytical pipeline (RAP).

It guides you through creating these models whilst **meeting requirements** from:

* üåø [Heather et al. 2025](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2501.13137) "On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models"
* üè• The ["Levels of RAP" framework](https://nhsdigital.github.io/rap-community-of-practice/introduction_to_RAP/levels_of_RAP/) from the NHS RAP Community of Practice 

The models are created using:

* **SimPy** for Python - <https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.
* **simmer** for R - <https://r-simmer.org/>.

**How to use this book?**

* **Go step-by-step**. Follow the book from beginning to end to build a reproducible DES model from scratch; or-
* **Pick and choose**. Skip around and dive into sections that are most helpful for your RAP or project.

**Note:** Even though the main example is about healthcare simulation, the tips on reproducibility and coding practices apply to all kinds of models, fields, and analysis techniques.
